@defmodule[the-unicoder]

@section{Usage}

This is a tool for inputting Unicode characters.

At the moment it only works on Unix systems running X11, and it requires
the program @code{xdotool} to be installed.  If you know how to do what
xdotool does on OSX or Windows, let me know.

To use @racket[the-unicoder], simply run @code{the-unicoder} or
@code{racket -l the-unicoder} in a terminal or from a keyboard
shortcut.  When the window pops up, simply type in the description for
the unicode character you want.  @code{the-unicoder} will display the
top ten results for your query so far, and when you hit enter the
dialog will go away, and the top result will be sent to the focused
window (whatever was focused before starting @code{the-unicoder}).
The top match will be the shortest description that matches each word
in your query string.  Included descriptions are the official
descriptions from the unicode standard, short latex-style names, and
custom descriptions/names you configure yourself.

Here are some screenshots:

@(define-runtime-path screenshot-psi-1 "screenshot-psi-1.png")
@(define-runtime-path screenshot-psi-2 "screenshot-psi-2.png")
@(define-runtime-path screenshot-cou-1 "screenshot-cou-1.png")
@image[screenshot-psi-1]
@image[screenshot-psi-2]
@image[screenshot-cou-1]

You may notice that its startup time is too long to make it terribly
useful for common use.  To improve this, you can run a the-unicoder
server and send it commands with a the-unicoder client.


Summary of options below:

@itemlist[
  @item{@code{--server}: Run a server that accepts commands.}
  @item{@code{--client}: Send a command to the server.}
  @item{@code{--path <path to socket>}: use a Unix domain socket at that path.  Currently only available on Unix-y systems like GNU/Linux, BSDs, and MacOSX.  But since the-unicoder currently only WORKS on X11 systems which are generally only used on GNU/Linux and BSDs, that doesn't seem like a huge issue.  Unless this or the @code{--port} option is used, the default socket for client/server interaction is a Unix port at @code{$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/the-unicoder/the-unicoder-socket}}
  @item{@code{--port <port number>}: use the given TCP port.  While it only accepts connections from localhost, it will still let anyone else with access to your machine send commands.  So, be ye warned.}
  @item{@code{--command <command name>}: Which command to use with the client.  Options are @code{prompt} (the default), and @code{reload} (reloads configuration files).}
  @item{@code{--help}: Show a list of options.}
]

@section{Configuration}

@code{the-unicoder} configuration files live in
@code{$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/the-unicoder/unicoder-table}
(@code{$XDG_CONFIG_HOME} defaults to @code{$HOME/.config} on Unix and
@code{C:\Users\username\AppData\Local} on Windows), or in
@code{$dir/the-unicoder/unicoder-table} where @code{$dir} is any
directory in @code{$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS}.  Multiple can be specified.

@code{unicoder-table} should consist of a single hash table readable by the default racket reader, like so:

@codeblock{
#hash(
("description of the letter upsilon" . "Ï…")
("description of the couch emoji" . "ðŸ›‹")
("lam" . "Î»")
("ycpash" . "you can put a string here")
)
}
